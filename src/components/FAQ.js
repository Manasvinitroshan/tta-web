<h1 className='text-3xl font-bold text-center  text-black'>Q: What kind of organization is Theta Tau Alpha?</h1>
<h2 className='text-black  mt-2'>A: Theta Tau Alpha is a professional engineering fraternity. The purpose of Theta Tau Alpha is to develop and maintain a high standard of professional interest among its members, and to unite them in a strong bond of fraternal fellowship. We separate ourselves from being a social fraternity because we emphasize professionalism as a common goal. Nonetheless, we hold many social events, such as intramural sports, camping, and fraternity potluck dinners, all of which foster brotherhood.</h2>

<h1 className='text-3xl font-bold text-center  text-black'>Q: Why should I consider Theta Tau Alpha?</h1>
<h2 className='text-black text-center'>A: What makes Theta Tau Alpha great is the development of its members. The area between social fraternity and honor society allows us to create an environment where students can grow academically, professionally, and socially. Professionalism is paramount, yet at the same time we don’t forget about the fundamental, social aspect of brotherhood; we ultimately help each other become well-rounded men and women. Theta Tau Alpha is a strong professional and social network that will last for life.</h2>

<h1 className='text-3xl font-bold text-center  text-black'>Q: What is “Rushing”?</h1>
<h2 className='text-black text-center'>A: “Rushing” is an open invitation for eligible students to learn about becoming a member of Theta Tau Alpha. Rush is usually held during the first few weeks of the fall and spring semesters. During this time you will see signs posted saying “Rush Theta Tau Alpha.” Theta Tau Alpha holds Rush events where we give out pizza, go bowling, BBQ, play sports among other activities. During this time, you first meet the members of Theta Tau and they get to meet you. The purpose is to let the brothers of Theta Tau Alpha know you are interested in joining. You also learn about the fraternity and the upcoming pledge process so you can make an informed decision about joining. During the two rush weeks, you are encouraged to come to as many rush events as possible. You should introduce yourself to the members and ask any questions they may have about Theta Tau Alpha. At the end of the rush period, the members of Theta Tau Alpha choose who will receive a bid to continue on to the pledge process.</h2>

<h1 className='text-3xl font-bold text-center  text-black'>Q: What is a “bid” and how do I receive one?</h1>
<h2 className='text-black text-center'>A: A “bid” is a formal invitation to pledge a fraternity. Bids are given out to rushees who have shown potential of being a good member of Theta Tau Alpha. To receive a bid, come out to the rush events. Get to know the current members, as the chances of receiving a bid increase by doing so. Immediately after the rush events, be sure to submit the “Interview Sign-Up” form on our website. After the interviews, the members will hold a meeting to determine which rushees may move on to the pledging process. If the members decide to allow the rushee to continue to the pledging process, that rushee will receive a bid.</h2>

<h1 className='text-3xl font-bold text-center  text-black'>Q: What if I cannot make it to events due to conflicts?</h1>
<h2 className='text-black text-center'>A: Pledges and members are highly encouraged to attend their respective meetings and activities. However, school comes first.

If you know you are going to absent, pledges should contact the Pledge Marshal; members should contact the Scribe.</h2>
